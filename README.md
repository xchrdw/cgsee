## Development Notes

If you are contributing to this project, please keep the following notes in mind:
* Add your name and email to the AUTHORS file.
* Follow coding conventions according to google's [C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml).
* Commits should provide a meaningful  message, which uses the imperative, present tense: "change", not "changed" nor "changes", AND start with a capital letter.
* Commits should always refer to an issue: use ```#xxx```, ```fix #xxx```, or ```close #xxx```.
* Pull Requests are reviewed by at least one other developer on another platform.
* Use lazy initialization as often as possible for time consuming tasks.
* Member Variables always start with m_ (e.g.,``` m_variable```).
* Interface or abstract class names always start with Abstract (e.g., ```AbstractPainter```).
* Enforce strict include sequence: own-header, gl, glew, std, glm, qt, other-3rdp, inhouse-party, cgsee (there might be few exceptions, e.g., gpuquery).

## Build Notes

CGSee is actively developed on all major platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux).
